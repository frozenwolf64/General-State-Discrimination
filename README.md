# General-State-Discrimination
This repository explores a quantum variational method of general state discrimination at theoretically allowed accuracy values as well a variation for dramatically decreasing the number of free parameters


The implementation is based on the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.08654). The notebook General State Discrimination explores the version proposed by the paper. The Special 2-qubit variation notebook explores a scalable method of discrimination with dramatically lower free parameters by focusing only on parametrizing a universal unitary. The second approach is much more useful when we do not want to preserve the state after measurement.
